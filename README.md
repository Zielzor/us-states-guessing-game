# us-states-guessing-game

Simple game created with Turtle Graphics and Pandas Library. Turtle handles all of the display, while Pandas handles .csv file.

<li> We use  blank_states file as a background, image has to be in .gif format (Turtle only works with this image format)
<li> States coors are in .csv file with x,y posisiton within our canvas - you need to get this manually.
<li> User is asked to name the state when the game starts, if guessed correctly you proceed  to name another one (all 50 of them)
<li> If you misspelled/not guessed the name, game moves forward for 50 time (number of states)
<li> At the end you end up with extra .csv file with the list of states you missed.
